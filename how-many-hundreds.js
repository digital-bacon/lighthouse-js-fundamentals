/* 
As humanity gets closer to living on Mars, we must start sending 
supplies to the red planet now, to prepare for our arrival. So Canada 
is going to start to send containers of maple syrup. Each container on 
the space ship can hold exactly 100 bottles of maple syrup. A 
container will only be sent if it's full.

Given a certain number of bottles, we need to determine how many 
containers can be filled and sent. In this challenge, we will write a 
function that determines how many hundreds can be made from a number.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
When this function is given a number, it should return how many 
hundreds fit into that number.

howManyHundreds(1000);  // 10
howManyHundreds(894);	  // 8
howManyHundreds(520);	  // 5
howManyHundreds(99);	  // 0
howManyHundreds(0);	    // 0
