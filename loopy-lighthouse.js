/*

Challenge
**************
We will be writing a program that prints the numbers from 100 to 200 to
the console, with three exceptions:

  - If the number is a multiple of 3, print the string "Loopy" instead
    of the number.
  - If the number is a multiple of 4, print the string "Lighthouse"
    instead of the number.
  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 4, print the string 
    "LoopyLighthouse" instead of the number.

By print, we are referring to console.log.

// Print numbers from 100 to 200, inclusive.
for (i = 100; i <= 200; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
